# The RL algorithm will be an instance of the RLAlgorithm abstract class defined in util.py. 
# In this case, you’ll want to use the Q-learning algorithm that you implemented in 4(a). 
# Once you’re done calling simulate, your RL will have explored and learned a policy from the MDP. 
# You will also want to run value iteration on the same MDP to get a policy pi
# Now that you have your trained Q-learning policy and value iteration policy, you can examine/explore the two and see where/how they differ. 
# You’ll want to think about how you can extract/query the policy from your trained Q-learning algorithm object.
